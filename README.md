Running Unit Tests
Weâ€™ve written unit tests for the API and the character list. Run them using these commands:

Test the API:                   npm test api.test.js
Test the Character List:        npm test CharacterList.test.js

Pagination Details:
The SWAPI (Star Wars API) uses a fixed pagination system where each API request returns a default 10 results per page. Custom page size modifications are not supported, meaning users cannot specify a different number of results per request. To retrieve additional data, multiple requests must be made to fetch subsequent pages.

Note: Since SWAPI does not support custom pagination, I have not implemented this feature in the practical task.
