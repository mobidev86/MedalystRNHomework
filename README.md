## Pagination Details
The SWAPI (Star Wars API) uses a fixed pagination system where each API request returns a default of 10 results per page. Custom page size modifications are not supported, meaning users cannot specify a different number of results per request. To retrieve additional data, multiple requests must be made to fetch subsequent pages.

**Note:** Since SWAPI does not support custom pagination, this feature has not been implemented in the practical task.
